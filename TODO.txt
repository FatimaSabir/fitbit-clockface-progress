isolate start/stop of sensors into singular handlers

add icons to stats instead of emoji (if you want to use transparency fill magic, 8-bit greyscale png)

battery - icon(s) or svg w/variable fill?
battery - color change for status?

"today" stats - how/when to update

settings
initial settings
i18n for settings

remake flags in the correct dims for file size reasons
black on flags - should we make it "black" instead of *black*

carefully choose colors for hrm/battery text to match icons

maybe apply choosable time color to all "whites" (date, stats)

make note somewhere about how to generate flags? `node .\FlagDefinitionsToSVGToPng.js`
